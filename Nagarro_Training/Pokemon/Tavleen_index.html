    <h3> GARY </h3>
    <p>
        Gary Oak is Ash's first rival. He is based on the character Blue from the Pokémon video game series. Like his
        counterpart Blue, Gary hails from Pallet Town and is the grandson of renowned Pokémon researcher Professor Oak.
        Like Ash, Gary collects Gym badges and competes in Pokémon League tournaments in Kanto and Johto. At first, Gary
        is arrogant, always traveling with cheerleaders who called out his name and constantly teases Ash's group
        whenever they meet. After losing to a more powerful opponent in the Indigo League, Gary dispenses with the
        cheerleaders and then becomes more open-minded.
